I started the assignment by linking the styles.css file to index.html, getting that part out of the way. Next, I modified the header section first since it was the most eyecatching part of the page. I added the background color, then changed the font color and style to match the screenshot. There was a problem I encountered right away: the background color didn't cover the entire header area. I fixed this by setting the padding and margin properties to zero for the body element; this allowed me to focus on the header's heights (adjusting padding) since there was no extra space on the sides.

It was easier for me to adjust the padding and margin properties and focus on the smaller details later. I moved to the main content and made some ajustments to the spacing and alignments. Then, I got to work with the quiz section. Adjusting the image was probably the hardest part because of how it was placed in the screenshot. Float right was the first thing I did, and that worked well. I had to change up the margins of both the image and quiz section through some attempts. Though the image does not look well aligned with the screenshot, it was the best I could do.

Finishing up the rest of the page was straightforward so I won't go into detail. I made some comments in the CSS file to explain why I made certain choices or adjustments.
